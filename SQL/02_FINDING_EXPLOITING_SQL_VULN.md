# Finding SQL Injection Vulnerabilities

## Black Box vs White Box Testing

1. **Black Box Testing**: The pentester (penetration tester) has
very little access to the web application's internals.
Usually, the only information available is the URL.

- Access the URL and map the application, test the endpoints,
analyze the DevTools information.

- Start off by running scans from tools such as: Sonarqube,
Fortify and Checkmarx.

- Submit SQL-specific characters such as: ' or ", and look
for errors or other anomalies, which give out information
about how the backend works.

- Submit BOOLEAN conditions, such as "OR 1=1", "OR 1=2",
looking for different behaviors to gain more information
about the application.

- Submit payloads designed to trigger **time delays**
when executed within a SQL query.

- Submit OAST (Out-of-band) payloads designed to trigger an
out-of-band network interaction when executed within a
SQL query, and monitor for any resulting interactions.

2. **White Box Testing**: Full access to the application's
components and source code.

- Enable web server logging

- Enable database logging

- Map the application (functionality and architecture)

- Regex search on all instances in the code that talk to the
database.

- Code Review ---> Follow the code path for all input
vectors.

- Test any potential SQL Injection Vulnerabilities.

3. **Gray Box Testing**: White + Black Box Pentesting.
